# Trading App

Personal framework for researching, backtesting, and running low-frequency (daily/weekly/monthly) trading strategies across stocks and ETFs. Python backend powers data pipelines, strategy execution, and APIs; a TypeScript frontend (e.g., Next.js/React or SvelteKit) will surface dashboards and controls.

## Current scope
- Backend scaffolding only — no implementations yet.
- Focus on clear separation of concerns: data ingestion/storage, strategies, backtesting/live execution, and APIs.

## Proposed backend layout
```
trading_app/
  config/            # Configuration objects
  data/              # Data schemas, ingestion pipeline, source/storage interfaces
    sources/
    storage/
  strategies/        # Strategy protocol and registry placeholder
  backtesting/       # Backtest engine + metrics stubs
  execution/         # Orders and broker abstractions
  portfolio/         # Portfolio state and risk interfaces
  services/          # Scheduler/event bus placeholders
  utils/             # Shared utilities (logging, time, etc.)
  interfaces/        # API boundary (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket)
  cli/               # CLI entrypoint stub
```

## Frontend note
A typed front-end framework such as **Next.js (React + TypeScript)** or **SvelteKit (TypeScript)** is recommended for dashboards, live charts, and strategy management. Choose based on developer preference; both integrate well with REST/GraphQL and WebSockets for live data.

## Getting started
1. Create and activate the virtual environment (already present at `.venv` if desired).
2. Install dev dependencies: `pip install -e .[dev]` (lock/package config to be added later).
3. Fill in implementations for data sources, storage, strategies, and APIs following the scaffolding above.
